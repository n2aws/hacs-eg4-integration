# Copilot Instructions for EG4 Integration

## Project Context
This project is a home assistant custom component for EG4 battery systems, designed to integrate with the Home Assistant platform using cloud polling. The integration will allow users to monitor and control their EG4 battery systems effectively.
It should follow the Home Assistant development standards and best practices, and be compatible with HACS for easy installation.

The integration will also support multiple EG4 inverters, allowing users to manage several systems from a single Home Assistant instance.

The integration will display a UI for configuration, and the configuration will allow the user to choose:
  - The EG4 inverter moddel (or models) they have.
  - The serial number for each EG4 inverter.
  - Indicate if the user has an EG4 gridboss, and if so, the serial number for the gridboss.

The integration will provide real-time data from the EG4 battery systems, including battery status, charge levels, and inverter performance metrics. It will also allow users to set preferences for notifications and alerts based on system performance.

The integration will include the YAML configuration to import a dashboard for visualizing the EG4 battery system data, providing users with an overview of their system's performance and status.

The integration will enable polling via TCP/IP, or USB to serial adapter directly to the EG4 hardware.



## Development Standards
Releases will follow semantic versioning, and the code will be structured to allow for easy updates and maintenance.
The integration will be developed using Python 3.9 or later, and will adhere to PEP 8 standards for code formatting.
The integration will include comprehensive unit tests to ensure reliability and performance. Documentation will be provided in the form of a README file, which will include installation instructions, configuration options, and usage examples.
The project will use pre-commit hooks to enforce code quality standards, including linting and formatting checks.


## Key Constraints
[Important limitations or requirements]

## Future Enhancements
- Support for additional EG4 hardware models.
- Integration with third-party notification services.

## Troubleshooting
- Log errors to Home Assistant's log file for easy debugging.
- Provide clear error messages for configuration issues.
- Ensure the integration is compatible with the latest Home Assistant version.
- Verify network connectivity for real-time data polling.

## Multi-Language Support
The integration includes translation files for multiple languages, enabling users to interact with the system in their preferred language. Supported languages include:
- English
- Spanish
- Chinese
- Japanese
- French
- German
- Italian
- Russian
- Arabic
- Portuguese
- Korean
- Hindi
- Turkish
- Dutch

### Translation Requirements
- All dialogs, prompts, and responses must use the translation files.
- Translation files should be updated whenever new features or text are added to the integration.
- Ensure the integration references the translation files for descriptions and placeholders in the configuration flow.

### Translation Updates
When adding or modifying translations, ensure that all supported language files are updated consistently. Do not prioritize or limit updates to a subset of languages. All language files listed in the `translations` folder must be updated.

### Error Prevention
To avoid repeated oversights, implement a checklist for tasks involving multiple files. For example:
1. Identify all files requiring updates.
2. Verify updates for each file before proceeding.
3. Confirm changes are applied to all files listed in the workspace.

### Accountability
If a user points out repeated oversights, prioritize addressing the root cause immediately. Document the issue in the `.copilot-instructions.md` file to prevent recurrence.
